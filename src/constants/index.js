I have worked on front-end technologies like React and Next.js, as well as back-end technologies like Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.I am currently learning and exploring new technologies to enhance my skills and knowledge in Software development.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hey, I’m Nishant Raj—a full-stack developer with a growing passion for Web3 technologies. I enjoy building functional, user-friendly applications, from designing frontends with tools like Node.js, Express.js, and EJS to diving into decentralized solutions using Solidity and IPFS.

I focus on writing clean, efficient code to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s creating smart contracts, implementing decentralized identity systems, or working on a Linux-based setup, I approach every challenge with curiosity and a drive to improve.

Outside of coding, I’m honing my skills in data structures, algorithms, and networking, always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.

If you’re looking for a developer to contribute to your Web3 or full-stack projects, let’s connect and create something meaningful.`;
